## An app to explore recovery actions for ESA-listed species.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service maintain a database, known as [ROAR](https://ecos.fws.gov/roar/pub/ConfigureRecActionReport.do?path=ROAR%20Custom%20Queries.Public%20Actions%20AdHoc) of recovery actions and the status (e.g., completed) of those actions. We downloaded that dataset in early May, 2016, and created this app to explore the >30,000 actions that are detailed.
