### _About_

This is an incomplete web app using data from the US Fish and Wildlife Service's [ROAR database](https://ecos.fws.gov/roar/pub/ConfigureRecActionReport.do?path=ROAR%20Custom%20Queries.Public%20Actions%20AdHoc). We plan to continue revising and updating this app as time progresses; see below if you'd like to contribute. Also feel free to check out a couple of simple working "papers" that use this data [here](https://defend-esc-dev.org/working_papers/recovery_actions_take_1.html) and [here](https://defend-esc-dev.org/working_papers/recovery_actions_take_2.html).

### _Quick Start_

You may use the filters on the left-hand side of the main page to winnow the dataset, and you may download the selected data on the Data Table page. (But use caution with downloading large selections...the app could crash.) Explore the plots, filter the data within the data table, and enjoy. 

### _Get Involved_

Would you like to work on this app, really flesh out the possibilities? You can [contact us](mailto:esa@defenders.org) or you can clone the [app repo](https://github.com/Defenders-ESC/recovery_actions), make changes, and then submit a pull request.

### _Find a bug?_

If you believe you have found a bug, please submit an Issue at the [project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Defenders-ESC/recovery_actions). Thank you for your input and patience!
